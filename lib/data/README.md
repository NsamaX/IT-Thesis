<h1 align="center">ðŸ“‚ Data ðŸ“¦</h1>

## Overview  

The `data/` directory serves as the core data management layer of the application. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and processing data from various sources, as well as handling data models used within the system.  

- **Local**: Connects to local storage and manages data via SQLite.  
- **Remote**: Connects to external APIs and handles data retrieval via HTTP requests.  
- **Repositories**: Acts as an intermediary between data sources (Local & Remote) and the business logic layer.
